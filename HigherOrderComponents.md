# Higher Order Components

-   A normal react component specifically made to help us reuse code inside an application
-   If there is a lot of duplicate code inside multiple components it is a perfect use for a higher order component

_component + HOC = enhanced/composed component with additional functionality or data_

-   Example of HOC:
    -   connect function in redux
